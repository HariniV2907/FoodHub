# FoodHub – Exploratory Data Analysis

This project explores customer and order data from FoodHub to uncover business insights through detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## 📌 Objective
Analyze the ordering behavior, delivery patterns, and rating trends to help FoodHub improve its service and customer satisfaction.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Key Analysis
- Delivery time trends and peak order categories
- Customer ratings and service type breakdown
- Correlation analysis between distance, delivery time, and satisfaction
- Graph selection based on data type (categorical vs numerical)

## 💡 Insights
- Most orders were placed for snack and fast food items.
- Delivery time and ratings showed moderate correlation.
- Pie and bar charts helped clearly visualize categorical variables.

## 🚧 Challenges
Choosing the right graphs was initially confusing, but a structured approach based on data types resolved this.

## 🧠 Learnings
- Improved ability to interpret data visually.
- Gained confidence in storytelling using plots and summaries.
